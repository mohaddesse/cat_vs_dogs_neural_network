# cat_vs_dogs_neural_network

the purpose of this programming is classification cats and dogs with and without neural network

- for neural network, I don't use libraries. I've implemented gradient descent in deep learning. it was so fun to understand how actual it works :)) 
- for classification I used to linear regression with and without sklearn library.

## collecting data

- link download: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data

there is a lot of data!! I can't use all of them with my little laptop!!!
and actually, the main purpose of this programming is to create a neural network step by step and verify hyperparameters ex: learning rate, number of iterations, number of layers, and number of neurons.
in collect_data.ipynb I sample data in 500,1000,3000 examples. instead of 25000 examples!!! 

## classification without neural network

in classification_without_neural.ipynb there is 2 parts:

- first part: classify pictures with 500,1000,3000 examples:
